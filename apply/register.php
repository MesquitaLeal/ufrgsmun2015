                <br/>
                <h6>Registering for UFRGSMUN 2014 is really easy. You just have to follow a few steps.</h6>
                <p>
                    <strong>Step 1: Putting together a delegation and selecting a head delegate</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first thing to do when putting together a delegation would be to find other
                    people that wish to take part in the other committees. Next, you should select
                    one or more countries from the <a href="?page=conference&section=countries">Country/Committee
                    Matrix</a> that have representatives in all the committees that you and your friends want
                    to participate in. Delegations may range from 1 (one) up to 20 (twenty) delegates. Then,
                    you should select a head delegate among the members from your delegation. That person will
                    be responsible for filling out registration forms, making payments, and staying in direct
                    contact with UFRGSMUN staff.

                </p>
                <p>
                    If you wish to represent a specific country, then you should invite enough people to
                    complete the delegation of this country, settling amongst yourselves who will be in
                    which committee. But remember that it is not certain that your first choice of country
                    will be designated to you. The number of delegates and the countries that you wish to
                    represent must be informed in Form A, which will be online from August 17th until
                    September 30th.
                </p>
                <p class="references">
                    NOTE: if you do not take part in a delegation and wish to be fitted in an existing
                    one, specific guidance will be provided to you in Form A.

                    <strong>Step 2: Filling in <a href="?page=apply&section=formA">Form A</a></strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once your delegation has decided which countries it would like to represent, the head
                    delegate must proceed to filling in Form A. During such procedure, the head delegate will
                    have to inform 12 (twelve) countries or combinations of countries that would please the
                    delegation the most. This is to facilitate the staff’s work in allocating preferences.
                    Throughout this process, it is important to remember that the number of delegates must
                    be equivalent to the number of spots demanded upon registration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example: If your delegation is composed of 16 delegates, you should choose twelve
                    combinations of countries whose sum is 16. An example of possible combination is: China
                    (6) + Pakistan (4) + Indonesia (3) + Iran (3) = 16 delegates. Or: Australia (5) +
                    Brazil (4) + Canada (3) + Cambodia (3) + Belarus (1) = 16 delegates.  If your
                    delegation is composed of only  6 delegates, you can ask for a single country,
                    like Nigeria (6), or for a combination as: Kazakhstan (3) + Jordan (2) + Liberia (1).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once your delegation—represented by the Head Delegate—has submitted this form, he or
                    she will receive an e-mail from the staff indicating exact payment procedures.

                    A fee per person of R$ 150.00 in full amount or two installments of R$ 75,00
                    applies in order to participate in the conference. Head delegates will have
                    the chance to choose in the registration form whether their delegations will
                    pay their corresponding delegate fees in two installments or in full amount.
                    The payment method chosen necessarily applies to all members of your delegation.
                    If one or more of the delegates of a delegation were selected and approved in our
                    “Edital de Benefícios” the head delegate must send an email to the secretariat notifying this.

                    UFRGSMUN’s bank is the Banco do Brasil and our account details will be forwarded
                    shortly after Form A is sent to us. Payments will be made by bank transfers.

                <p>
                    Once finished, the transfer receipt must be sent to our email or the registration
                    will not be completed. After that, head delegates will receive a confirmation e-mail
                    from UFRGSMUN staff. We strongly encourage head delegates to make just one transfer
                    for the whole delegation so as to make the registration process easier. When the full
                    amount or the first installment of the payment and the transfer receipt are received
                    by the Staff, the Head Delegate will receive a confirmation e-mail. Another confirmation
                    e-mail will be sent once the second installment is paid.
