                    <strong>Step 1: Filling in Form A and receiving payment instructions</strong><br/>
                    When filling in <a href="?page=apply&section=formA">Form A</a>, head delegates will have to choose between payment in full
                    amount or two installments (for fees, check <a href="?page=apply&section=register">How to Register</a>). Shortly after that,
                    head delegates will receive payment instructions directly from our staff through their
                    registered e-mail account.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    <strong>Step 2: Payment</strong><br/>
                    UFRGSMUNâ€™s bank is the Banco do Brasil and our account details will be forwarded
                    shortly after Form A is sent to us. Payments will be made by bank transfers.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    <strong>Step 3: Confirmation</strong><br/>
                    Once finished, the transfer receipt must be sent to our email or the registration
                    will not be completed. After that, head delegates will receive a confirmation e-mail
                    from UFRGSMUN staff. We strongly encourage head delegates to make just one transfer
                    for the whole delegation so as to make the registration process easier.
