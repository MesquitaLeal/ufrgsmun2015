                <h4 class="socialEvents-date">(Friday, October, 30th)</h4>
                <p>The traditional happy hour after the opening cocktail is going to be in a bar at Cidade Baixa. We invite you to get to know other delegates over drinks or beers (alcohol-free options are also available of course). It's time to get ready for UFRGSMUN 2015!</p>

                        <p>If you work together for 5 days, you better get to know and share experiences with your fellow delegates, right? That's why on our second day we will have all delegates of a same committee having dinner together. This type of social event is very popular in various MUNs and it offers a chance to interact with people from other universities or courses, share ideas and chat in a non-formal manner. Restaurants won't be expensive and all of them will be at Cidade Baixa, a few blocks walk from the bar where we will have the Talent Show.</p>

                        <p>After dinner, delegates and UFRGSMUNS’s staff go straight to the Papillon Bar, where we will get on stage and show our hidden talents. Always funny and already a classic, delegates and delegations may perform on stage anything they would like: singing, dancing, reciting, stand-up comedy and others. Everybody – talented or not – is highly encouraged to cheer.</p>

                <h4 class="socialEvents-date">(Sunday, November, 1st)</h4>
                <p>
                    <i>UFRGSMUN’s Costume Party: What's your revolution?</i><br/>
                    As usual, we will hold an insane open bar party.This year the theme is, well, revolutionary. You can dress as anything or anyone that caused a revolution in your life. From the French Revolution (off with their heads), the Industrial Revolution (steam punk looks, anyone?), the Feminism movement (Mary Wollstonecraft, Angela Davis, suffragettes, Malala, so many to choose!), to the Communist revolution (bolsheviks, Chinese revolutionaries) and even people who were revolutionary for you (from Carl Sagan or Nelson Mandela to your grandmother). Be creative (and respectful of other cultures)! We don't need 300 Che Guevaras.

                <h4 class="socialEvents-date">(Monday, November, 2nd)</h4>
                <p>The FIFA World Cup has come and gone, but don't worry, there are still lots of people who love soccer around here. Teams can be mixed, good or horrible, it doesn't matter, everyone can play! If you don't like soccer, it's fine, we will have some entertainment for you as well (tip: it may involve sitting and/or singing). While you get ready to pretend to be Ronaldo, we will also have a typical gaucho barbecue (the one and only true barbecue) and beer. There will be a vegetarian option as well.</p>

                <h4 class="socialEvents-date">(Tuesday, November, 3rd)</h4>
                <p>It's always terribly sad to see you all go. This is the last goodbye before UFRGSMUN 2015 is finally over, even if all the resolutions were (not) approved. It's time to also plan for the next MUN and celebrate these new friendships and experiences we've all had. We will meet at Boteco Imperial, at Rua Santana, 375, a few blocks walking from where our closing ceremony will be.</p>
