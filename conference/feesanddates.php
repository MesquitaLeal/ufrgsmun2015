            <p>Regular registration period goes from August 15th through September 20th.</p>
            <p>Registration is split in two parts, the Form A and the Form B, which will be available on our website. Each of these forms will be open for a specific time period, so pay attention to the registration schedule.</p>
            <p>After submitting each form, you will receive a confirmation email with some instructions concerning payment. If you pay on time, you will be charged the regular fee. Still, delegates may submit forms at a later date as well as the payments, but they will be charged slightly higher fees. You may also not get the country you want to represent, so try to register on time!</p>
            <p>A fee per person of R$ 130.00 in full amount or R$ 140.00 divided in two installments applies in order to participate in the conference. Head delegates will have the chance to choose in the registration form whether their delegations will pay their corresponding delegate fees in two installments or in full amount. The payment method chosen necessarily applies to all members of your delegation.</p>
            <p>Head delegates are responsible for gathering the money of their delegations and sending the payment to UFRGSMUN.</p>

                <h3>Regular Registration Period</h3>
                <p>
                    Dates on the forms:
                    <br/>Form A: from August 15th through September 20th
                    <br/>Form B: from September 27th through October 9th
                </p>
                <p>
                    Total fees per delegate for regular registration:
                    <br/>Full amount: R$ 130.00
                    <br/>Payment deadline: September 26th
                    <br/>Two installments: R$ 140.00
                    <br/>First payment deadline: September 26th
                    <br/>Fee: R$ 70.00

                </p>
                <p>
                    NOTE: Delegates who register on time, but do not succeed in making payments on time as 
                    well will be charged R$ 10.00 for each delayed payment. For example, if your delegation 
                    has decided to pay in two installments but fails to pay R$ 70.00 until September 26th 
                    you will have to pay R$ 80.00, but the second payment remains unaltered as long as it 
                    is paid on time. The same rule applies for payments made in full amount.
