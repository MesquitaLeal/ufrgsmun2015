                    The International Law Commission (ILC) was created in 1947 by the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 174 as a means of fulfilling the General Assembly’s objective, stated in Article 13, paragraph 1.a, of the UN Charter, of “encouraging the progressive development of international law and its codification”. Through, respectively, the preparation of draft conventions on matters that do not possess regulation in international law and the more accurate formulation and systematization of rules of international law in areas where there is significant State practice, precedent and doctrine, the Commission seeks to attain its main objects – that of developing international law and that of codifying it. The ILC has played a leading role in the crystallization of emerging customary norms of international law.

                    The ILC is competent to analyze matters not only in the field of public international law (though most of its activity has been concentrated in this area) but also in that of private and international criminal law, according to its Statute. The main objective of the work of the Commission is to prepare draft conventions, however two other possibilities are contemplated by the ILC Statute: the simple publication of its report or a resolution of the General Assembly taking note of or adopting the report (ILC Statute, Article 23, paragraph 1).

                <p>
                    Regarding its Statue, the Commission is composed of 34 members, which “shall be persons of recognized competence in international law” (ILC Statute, Art. 2, paragraph 1). The Candidates are nominated by the Governments of Member States and are elected by the UN General Assembly (ILC Statute, Art. 3). Although the eligibility for membership is not restricted to nationals of UN Member States, no national of non-UN Member States has ever been elected. Similarly to the judges of the International Court of Justice, the members of the Commission sit in their individual capacity, not representing the interests of their respective governments. However, it’s important to remind that two nationals of the same State cannot be members of the ILC at the same time.

                    The Commission’s annual session is held in Geneva, Switzerland, for a period of ten to twelve weeks, as approved by the General Assembly

        <h6>Crimes against humanity</h6>
        <p>
            Despite being one of the core crimes in the field of international law, crime against humanity is still a controversial concept. The emergence of the concept dates back to the 1899 Hague Convention - its Martens Clause mentioned the laws of humanity and the dictates of public conscience when devising the protection of persons in times of war. The jurisdiction of the tribunals of Nuremberg and Tokyo, established in the aftermath of the World War II, included as a component crimes against humanity. In 1946 the General Assembly reaffirmed the principles of international law recognized in the Nuremberg Charter and it also charged the International Law Commission (ILC) to devise those principles - indeed, in 1950 the Commission established the present concept of crimes against humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later, in 1968 the General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity, which called upon States to criminalize such acts within their internal systems. Still this instrument focused only statutory limitations, as such it does not thoroughly obligate a Party to exert jurisdiction over crimes against humanity. In 1993 the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia included crimes against humanity to its jurisdiction and in 1994 the Statute for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda did the same. The ILC set crimes against humanity into its 1996 draft code of crimes against the peace and security of mankind. This conception was of paramount importance to the incorporation of crime against humanity into the 1998 Rome Statute that founded the International Criminal Court (ICC).
        </p>
        <p>
            The ILC decided to include the topic “Crimes against humanity” in its programme of work at its sixty-sixth session in 2014 based on the recommendation of the Working Group on the long-term programme of work (ILC 2013a). Crimes against humanity is the only core crime under the jurisdiction of the major international criminal tribunals established to date that has not yet been addressed by a global treaty – genocide has been codified by the means of the 1948 Genocide Convention and war crimes have been codified by means of the 1949 Geneva Conventions. As no such comparable instrument exists concerning crimes against humanity, thus there is no requirement for the States to prevent and punish said conduct and to cooperate among themselves to achieve these ends.
        </p>
        <p>
            The perpetration of such crimes remains an atrocious reality in a number of hostilities worldwide. The evident lack in the framework of international humanitarian law, international criminal law and international human rights law could only be met by the establishment of a global convention on crimes against humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
            In such way, the role of the ILC is to devise the draft articles for the making of a Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Humanity. Insofar, the key elements to be considered for such Convention are (i) how to define the offence of “crimes against humanity” for purposes of the Convention (ii) how to require the Parties to criminalize the offence in their national legislation, (iii) how to require robust inter-State cooperation by the Parties for investigation, prosecution, and punishment of the offence and (iv) how to impose an aut dedere aut judicare obligation when an alleged offender is present in a Party’s territory.
