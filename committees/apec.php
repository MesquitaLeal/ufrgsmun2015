                The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation is the main economic forum in the Asia-Pacific region. Its goal is to improve economic growth and prosperity by sustainable means and to establish a more integrated community. Created in 1989 and uniting 21 countries from the region, APEC has been working to promote strategies to ensure the support for open and free trade and investment and encouraging regional economic integration.

                Its 21 economies combine 2.8 billion people, representing almost 57 per cent of world GDP and 47 per cent of world trade in 2012. With the creation of APEC, members have enhanced their GDPs and per capita income, achieved by the boost in trade through reduction of trade barriers, harmonizing standards and regulations and facilitating customs procedures. Throughout the years, APEC has broadened its scope of action and started to discuss several other issues in the region.

                The most important meeting is the APEC Economic Leaders Meeting, held every year in the second semester. All 21 member economies participate in the meeting, represented by their Head of State, along with 3 observer members. Furthermore, APEC works with non-binding commitments and dialogue, and all decisions are taken under consensus.

            <h6>Free Trade Agreements in<br/> the Asia-Pacific Region</h6>
            <p>
                The current and potential Free-Trade Agreements embracing the Asia-Pacific Region constitutes what is commonly called this region’s “noodle bow” of standards, rules of origin, obligations and other elements of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). Besides being a complex situation per se – once trade and investment in the area becomes more complicated -, the existence of overlapping and maybe competing potential agreements brings with it a dense net of political implications. Moreover, especially considering that the world’s two biggest economies are involved, as well as fast-growing and exporting countries, the economical ties embraced by it are globally important.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the APEC leaders meeting in Beijing, in November 2014, when the pursue of the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) was committed by countries’ Chiefs of State, and especially endorsed by the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, the question of how it will be achieved has become central in debates concerning the future of the Region. Mainly involved with this issue are the two mega-agreements currently under negotiations: the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), currently headed by the United States, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), centered in ASEAN countries (Tran and Heal 2014). TPP is an already existing agreement, created in 2006 by Singapore, New Zealand, Brunei and Chile, joined by the US in 2008, being nowadays an initiative under discussion among 12 countries, including also Japan, Canada and Australia, and excluding China (Fergusson and Vaughn 2011). For its turn, RCEP is an initiative comprising 16 countries – the 10 ASEAN members, China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand (ASEAN 2013). If by one hand there is a lot of speculation about the competing nature of this three arrangements, specially opposing China’s and U.S. leaderships, by the other hand the possible complementarity of the overlapping initiatives have also been mentioned (Keck 2014; Richards 2014). That is, all the cards still on the table and negotiations may lead either to an amplified TPP or RCEP, or to a singular initiative leading to the FTAAP, if it is concluded after all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any of these agreements, if accomplished, may establish a completely new set of rules and standards of trade, once it may involve a large amount of world’s GDP and trade. This situation can have diverse implications, depending on the countries involved. A concluded TPP that excludes China, for example, would put it in a severe situation with its currently major traders (Tran ad Heal 2014). That is, the majority of countries in the Asia-Pacific Region might have to choose between entering in a deal in which the conditions may harm its economy or being out of it and suffer diversion of trade and investment, besides maybe losing close political ties with some countries. The solution seems to be to exhaustibly negotiate the terms of the agreements and try to get a favorable final result. The foreign policies of all countries comprised by the Asia-Pacific Region are highly constrained by worries about FTAs and its consequences. Therefore, it seems that reaching a lasting and comprehensive agreement involves a huge set of interests and implications, which certainly hampers an easy achievement of any kind of deal.
