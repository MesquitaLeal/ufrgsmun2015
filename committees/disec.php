                The Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC), also known as the First Committee, is one of the six main committees of the United Nations General Assembly. It addresses disarmament and international security matters in the light of the general principles of cooperation to the maintenance of international peace and security, in order to prevent the disruption of armed conflict and the heightening of tensions in the international system. Since the past decade, the committee has been focusing on issues of nuclear non-proliferation, small arms illicit traffic and regional militarization.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly, the DISEC is entitled to present its recommendations over the issues under its consideration to a plenary meeting of the Assembly, usually in the form of draft resolutions and decisions. Through this mechanism, the First Committee has been the primary origin of legal initiatives that led to important international treaties and conventions, such as the Treaty of Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 1968 and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1996.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each Member State of the United Nations is represented by one delegate in this committee and decisions on draft resolutions and recommendations are approved on a two-thirds majority basis, turning the DISEC into a broad and inclusive platform for the debate of pertinent issues concerning the maintenance of international peace and security.

            <h6>Topic A<br/>Missile Defense Systems</h6>
            <p>
                The Missile Defense Systems are devices that combine anti-aircraft missiles (SAMs), radars, computers and command and control stations, in order to shoot Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) (MDA 2009; O’Rourke 2013). These systems have been developed and installed in specific locations of the globe, such as in Eastern Europe and East Asia, causing political and strategic impacts in both global and regional levels (Johnson-Freese & Savelsberg 2013; Martins & Cepik 2014). Reportedly, their installation purposes are strictly defensive. However, given their potential and reach, these systems can be also responsible for affecting the capacities of some countries to retaliate against a foreign aggression. This capability, called second-strike capability, is one of exclusivities of the great powers (Cepik 2013). Accordingly, the Missile Shields have a direct connection with the polarity and may be responsible for the change in the international balance and for the climbing crises (Piccolli 2012; Pifer, 2012; Martins & Cepik 2014).
            </p>
            <p>
                In this context, countries’ influence areas are a central element, becoming source of disputes across the globe. The situations are always complex and requires deep reflections by every side. The common scenario is one side claiming that just want to remain sovereign over its territory, while the stronger side insists that, by doing this, the capabilities of the first one are actually jeopardizing its own national security in comparison to a third country. In turn, this third country claims that the systems’ purpose is keeping its own people safe from a fourth country’ weapons. A web of allegations and values holds the tension in high levels, as the polarization. Practical examples of these situations could be seen in in the Eastern Europe, especially the Ukrainian crisis, in Eastern Asia, Korean Peninsula and Japanese-Chinese relations, and in the Persian Gulf with Israel-Iran (Kron 2009; Hildreth & Ek 2011; Piccolli 2012). In spite of been geographically far from each other, they all share the principles stated above, been connected in the high politics level also (Martins & Cepik 2014).
            </p>
            <p>
                In this sense, the international community must address the Missile Defense System’s debate. Questions about the threats to countries’ sovereignty by systems grounded outside its territory, or concerning possible violations of international treaties are central to this debate. The relevance of the topic is not only about its high potential for political instability between the actors of the international system, but also about its practical influence in the conduct of military, economic and social actions in various regions on the globe. Therefore, the Disarmament and International Security committee (DISEC) could be the democratic space in strengthening trust ties between the UN members, and granting more control over future crises’ escalation.

            <h6>Topic B<br/>Prevention Against an<br/> Arms Race in Outer Space</h6>
            <p>
                The importance of space-based technologies can be seen in our everyday life: telecommunications, agriculture, energy, commerce, transportation and innumerous other usages. In a matter of fact, the world is becoming increasingly dependent of space activities and its technologies. This dependence, however, is also the matrix of concerns on the possibility of it becoming a new theatre of war (FAS 2004). Having in mind specific aspects of space, that is, different levels of orbits and the limitation of spatial regions of interest, space can be understood as a new geopolitical level (Klein 2006).
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the historically known fact that the space age began in 1957, with the launch of Sputnik-1 by the USSR, the national interest in space existed since 1946 (Kali 2012). The arms race in the Cold War was greatly influenced by the new space technologies and activities. Probably, the peak of the arms race in space was the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI, also known as Star Wars, proposed by U.S. President Ronald Reagan in 1983.  With operations Desert Storm in the Persian Gulf in 1991, Allied Force in Serbia in 1999, Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraqi Freedom in 2003, a new way of making war was empowered by a space-enabled global reconnaissance, precision-strike complex (Hays 2007). Since 2000, approximately 70% of all satellites in space are used for military purposes, such as communication, detection, surveillance, and tracking (Dunningan 2003). Space portrays an important part in wars, and therefore in every countries strategies, of this new century.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having acknowledged the importance of space for countries like the United States and Russia, it should be noted that space activities in the twenty-first century will not be limited only by them. In January 2007 China made a test and launched a missile that successfully destroyed one of its aging weather satellites (New York Times 2007). The increasingly efforts of countries like China, India, South Korea, Israel and Brazil to create its own space complex activities shows a world where multiple interest will be laid on outer space. But with many increasing, and possibly diverging interests, the States may face a militarization of this process, creating a difficult scenario for space stabilization.
            </p>
            <p>
                The strategic importance of space has been shown that it will be played a major role in this century. Nonetheless, the agreements and treaties about this subject are still very limited, impeding an equitable use of space by international law. The first and most commonly known is the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, formally known as the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies. This treaty prohibits nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction from space. However, the 1967 Treaty is outdated and the most recent resolution related to this subject passed more than 13 years ago (Klein 2006). Treaties or agreements about what are space weapons or about a clear definition of outer space do not exist, creating an ambiguous scenario in the current space expansion: if microsatellites can be used against another country´s space asset, should they be considered for potential military use? Can a country´s emerging space program be considered a possible military act? Who should enforce the demilitarization of space and regulate the strategic uses of every country in the different types of orbits, the Security Council?
            </p>
            <p>
                In this simulation, delegations, facing the potential uses of space, will discuss about its strategic and military use, aiming to create guidelines about the demilitarization of space and its peaceful uses. To do so, definitions about the militarization and weaponization of space will have to be laid on the discussion table, in order to reach an understanding of such a ponderous topic. The debate taking place in this committee will question the current strategic use of space and forge a new framework to prevent an arms race in outer space.
