			<p>Perhaps one of UFRGSMUN's dearest branches ever spread, UFRGSMUN BACK IN SCHOOL has been developing since 2007, and truly shows the effectiveness of modelling as a learning technique. Its execution is only possible due to the commitment of our staff members, who carry out activities in public schools of Porto Alegre, bringing the Model UN world into public high school students' lives.
				As a result of its commitment to society, UFRGSMUN's staff has developed a program to bring the UN principles to High School students, showing them how global issues relate to their lives. UFRGSMUN BACK IN SCHOOL combines classroom activities with UN simulation, giving students an opportunity to acquire knowledge while learning from each other.
				It is structured in two encounters: the first, a comprehensive lecture on the United Nations - how it was developed, what it is and how it works - and on a relevant topic of the international agenda. That is also the day in which the staff members explain the Model UN rules, give out study material to all students and assign them a Country to be represented. Given time for the students to gather more material and discuss the approach they will take, which varies between one or two weeks, the staff members once again go to the school and then moderate the debate on the topic introduced in the first encounter.
				The whole process is fascinating, and promotes a paradigm-shifting environment for both the high school students and staff members. The massive amount of students does incredibly well, enjoys the debate, and shows us that there is an enormous power in active participation in the learning process. This is UFRGSMUN understanding our society, building respect for differences and gathering the strength and courage to change what needs to be changed.

			<p>It is a known fact that MUNs are one of the most effective ways to learn. They not only teach us international relations or international law, but also how to convince and negotiate, how to speak in public and other skills so necessary to any professional - UFRGSMUN has had participants from various courses, ranging from Physics and Environmental Engineering through Law, History, Social Sciences, and, of course, International Relations. Understanding how the world works and how people work are an undeniable necessity, so important that is valued as key in applications to all the best universities in the world.
				In spite of our great tradition of modelling among university students, southern Brazil lacked a fundamental tool for our Model UN tradition to be completed: High School MUNs. Last year, however, a shift began, and UFRGSMUN broke ground in helping the promotion of the first High School MUN in southern Brazil, MUNDO CMPA, at Col√©gio Militar de Porto Alegre (Military School of Porto Alegre).
				In addition to that, this year will be the first UFRGS Mundi, one of the first high school MUNs open for all such institutions in Southern Brazil.

			<h5>Preparation Course</h5>
			<p>One of the many differentials of UFRGSMUN as a Model UN is its academic excellence. In order to promote that culture among students and scholars - who may be MUNers, future MUNers or those who merely take interest in subjects relevant to the international agenda - UFRGSMUN promotes a course on Saturdays during most part of the first semester of the year at the University.
				The true twist is, however, that, after five days of introductory lectures on the foundational themes of international studies, the students get to get truly acquainted with rules of procedure, study guides' peculiar language and diplomacy skills of different sorts of committees simulated in UFRGSMUN through actual simulations. During these encounters, the Directors, Assistants and the Secretariat of UFRGSMUN moderate and act as special delegates to show the future delegates and/or enthusiasts how an actual MUN works.
				For sure, it creates an environment that helps us maintain the high standards of better prepared delegates that promote a great flow to the debates during UFRGSMUN and other MUNs throughout Brazil, as well as brings to the table at the University as a whole the possibility to discuss and think International Relations, especially the UN System and International Law.
