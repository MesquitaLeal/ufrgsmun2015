				<h3 class="center">UFRGSMUN Back in School</h3>
				<p>
					The UFRGSMUN BIS (Back in School) project, created in 2008, aims to take the relevant debates in the current international scenario to the classrooms of the public high schools of Porto Alegre and its metropolitan region. To this end, BIS, managed from the beginning by students from UFRGS, uses the model of the United Nations conference simulations as a teaching tool. This model is already established in the academia, as a graduation activity in various universities around the world.
					The main objective of BIS is to bring the topics of International Relations to public school students in order to sharpen critical thinking, practice oratory, and stimulate debate about global issues. UN models are events where students simulate UN agencies and comitees, acting as delegates, representing and defending the foreign policies of countries. BIS, however, is not restricted to UN agencies, extending its scope to regional organizations such as CELAC and the African Union. Today, the BIS team consists of college students of various courses.

				<h3 class="center">UFRGSMUNDI</h3>
				<p>
					Awarded at UFRGS Extension Hall in 2014, UFRGSMUNDI aims to promote the discussion of important topics on the international agenda among high school students from public and private schools of Rio Grande do Sul. Discussions are structured in committees that simulate international diplomatic conferences and courts of justice, in which the participants act as representatives of countries, judges and reporters. Thus, the project is a tool for those interested in teaching and learning about International Relations, thereby contributing to personal and intellectual growth of the students. It also provides them opportunities to know more about other realities and helps with the developomment of their communication, argumentation, negotiation and leadership skills.
					Organized by undergraduates from various courses – International Relations, Law, Communication and Design – UFRGSMUNDI provides participants with supporting materials made and reviewed by undergraduate and postgraduate students from UFRGS. These are presented in a Study Guide format, which aim to supply delegates with an excellent and easy to understand material, this way assisting their preparation for simulation. The guides are compiled in an annual academic journal, which is printed and distributed to participating schools before the event.
					This way, by combining participants from the university and secondary schools, the project also promotes the exchange of experiences between the University and the Society, bringing together realities that often seem distant.

				<h3 class="center">RIPE</h3>
				<p>
					The project aims to promote the democratization of the debate of International Relations in schools, taking as a starting point a comparative approach between the brazilian and international political reality. Therefore, RIPE tries to encourage interest and the construction of a critical view among brazilian students, providing subsidies to the continuing education of teachers in the study and understanding of national and international political phenomena.
					The RIPE consists of a short course on topics of International Relations for history, geography, and sociology teachers from public schools in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, aiming to encourage the discussion of International Relations issues in the classroom. It occurs during the first semester of each year and in 2016 will have its sixth edition.
